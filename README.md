# My Week In Meetings

**Work in Progress**

_How much time did you spend in meetings last week?_
_How much time do you have to spend in meetings this week?_

Time is slippery and worst can be squandered all too easily.

This is a simple intervention to make you aware about the time you have to spend in planning or other obligation.
And the time left for _grease-on-hands_ work.

If you are a fan of [deep work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), you will appreciate this new found awareness. And possibly make _wise_ decisions.

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
